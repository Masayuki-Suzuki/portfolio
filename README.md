## Design process
### 1. Planing
#### Goal
Thinking what should I exhibit my skills in this website. Also planning and choosing what technology I'll use.
#### Colour
As a main colour, I've  chosen Ivory colour because it gives chic impression. For the sub colour, I've chosen dark gray (it's almost black but not). It gives calm impression that is combined with Ivory colour.

### 2. Design
#### Wireframe
I usually use paper and pen to make wireframe, sometimes use Tablet(iPad) and Stylus pen. Because it can make wireframe more quickly than applications before my inspiration and passion is vanished.
#### Logo
Made by SVG with Adobe illustrator.
#### Mockup
Using Sketch App.

### 3. Development
#### Coding
I've used WebStorm.
#### Vue.js
