# Masayuki Suzuki Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio showing my front-end development skills.   
See actual website : <http://masa.works>

## Skills and technologies I used
* HTML5
* CSS
* SASS / SCSS
* Javascript (Including ES6)
* [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [Vue-touch](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-touch) - For a Vue.js plugin for getting touch event.
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for a back-end.
* [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [EJS](https://github.com/mde/ejs) - Embedded JavaScript templates.
* [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
* [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) - The compiler for writing next generation JavaScript.
* Gulp
* Webpack

## Applications I used
* WebStorm
* Sketch
* Photoshop
* illustrator

## Server Environment
* Ubuntu 16.04 on VPS.
* Node.js - Web server.
* Nginx - For reverse proxy.

## Design process
### 1. Planing
#### Goal
Thinking what should I exhibit my skills in this website. Also planning and choosing what technology I'll use.
#### Colour
As a main colour, I've  chosen Ivory colour because it gives chic impression. For the sub colour, I've chosen dark gray (it's almost black but not). It gives calm impression that is combined with Ivory colour.

### 2. Design
#### Wireframe
I usually use paper and pen to make wireframe, sometimes use Tablet(iPad) and Stylus pen. Because it can make wireframe more quickly than applications before my inspiration and passion is vanished.
#### Logo
Made by SVG with Adobe illustrator.
#### Mockup
Using Sketch App.
#### Animation
I haven't used a library like GSAP because I've wanted to code from scratch in order to improve my javascript skills. Also I haven't used Fullpage.js.
 Â 
### 3. Development
#### Coding
I've used WebStorm.
#### Vue.js
**Why Vue.js ?** - These days, Javascript framework demand is increasing and javascript developers are required knowledge and experience them. 
The typical frameworks are Angular and React but Vue is getting more and more popular moreover Vue is getting Star and Watch more than Angular in Github. Vue is simpler than React and Angular and very light weight and fast and it's easier to learn than another framework. Actually, I had no experience and knowledge of JS framework, so I have needed to learn them and I've chosen Vue to my first time JS framework. 
#### Node.js
**Why Node.js ?** - Almost Node user would say that "Node.js is faster than another server". But I reckon it isn't a strong motive to choose Node. So why have I chosen Node? Of course, one of the reasons is that it's fast but it's not only. Because Node is built by Javascript, so we are possible to make apps with only using one programming language although front-end or back-end. And then, Javascript developer can work in both fields and It would make communication smooth between developers. Finally, It would lead to reducing labor cost. And another strong reason is **I would love to be MEA(R/V) N Stack Developer.**
#### CSS Architecture
BEM(<http://getbem.com/naming/>)  
OOCSS(<http://oocss.org/>)
  
### 4. Performance Optimaization
* Images - Compressed and responsive image size.
* CSS - Combined to one file and minified.
* js file - Compressed and bundle with webpack.
* Gzip - Compressed website's data before sending those data from server.
* Server Location - Located in San Jose, US which is physically close to my target users living in Vancouver, BC Canada.

## The More to Do
* Refactor javascript code to write DRY, small, readable and effectively.
* Using svg sprite to decrease http request.
* Opening load animation.
* Load blog post using ajax from wordpress.
* Add Parallax animation when site is touch devices.
* Learn Vue.js more.
